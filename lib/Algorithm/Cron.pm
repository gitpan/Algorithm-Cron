=head1 NAME

C<Algorithm::Cron> - abstract implementation of the F<cron(8)> scheduling
algorithm

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Algorithm::Cron;

 my $cron = Algorithm::Cron->new(
    base => 'local',
    crontab => "*/10 9-17 * * *",
 );

 my $time = time;
 while(1) {
    $time = $cron->next_time( $time );

    sleep( time - $time );

    print "Do something\n";
 }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Objects in this class implement a time scheduling algorithm such as used by
F<cron(8)>. Objects are stateless once constructed, and represent a single
schedule as defined by a F<crontab(5)> entry. The object implements a method
C<next_time> which returns an epoch timestamp value to indicate the next time
included in the crontab schedule.

=head2 Crontabs

The schedule is provided as a set of acceptable values for each field of the
broken-down time (as returned by C<localtime> or C<gmtime>), either in a
single string called C<crontab> or by a set of named strings, each taking the
name of a F<crontab(5)> field.

 my $cron = Algorithm::Cron->new(
    base => 'local',
    crontab => '0 9 * * mon-fri',
 );

Z<>

 my $cron = Algorithm::Cron->new(
    base => 'local',
    min  => 0,
    hour => 9,
    wday => "mon-fri",
 );

A C<crontab> field containing a single asterisk (C<*>), or a missing named
field, indicates that any value here is included in the scheduled times. To
restrict the schedule, a value or set of values can be provided. This should
consist of one or more comma-separated numbers or ranges, where a range is
given as the start and end points, both inclusive.

 hour => "3-6"
 hour => "3,4,5,6"

Ranges can also be prefixed by a value to give the increment for values in
that range.

 min => "*/10"
 min => "0,10,20,30,40,50"

The C<mon> and C<wday> fields also allow symbolic month or weekday names in
place of numeric values. These names are always in the C locale, regardless of
the system's locale settings.

 mon => "mar-sep"

 wday => "mon,wed,fri"

Specifying C<sun> as the end of a C<wday> range, or giving the numeric value
of C<7> is also supported.

 wday => "fri-sun"
 wday => "5-7"
 # Both equivalent to: wday => "0,5,6"

As per F<cron(8)> behaviour, this algorithm looks for a match of the C<min>,
C<hour> and C<mon> fields, and at least one of the C<mday> or C<mday> fields.
If both C<mday> and C<wday> are specified, a match of either will be
sufficient.

As an extension, seconds may be provided either by passing six space-separated
fields in the C<crontab> string, or as an additional C<sec> field. If not
provided it will default to C<0>. If six fields are provided, the first gives
the seconds.

=head2 Time Base

C<Algorithm::Cron> supports using either UTC or the local timezone when
comparing against the given schedule.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=cut

=head2 $cron = Algorithm::Cron->new( %args )

Constructs a new C<Algorithm::Cron> object representing the given schedule
relative to the given time base. Takes the following named arguments:

=over 8

=item base => STRING

Gives the time base used for scheduling. Either C<utc> or C<local>.

=item crontab => STRING

Gives the crontab schedule in 5 or 6 space-separated fields.

=item sec => STRING, min => STRING, ... mon => STRING

Optional. Gives the schedule in a set of individual fields, if the C<crontab>
field is not specified.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 @minutes = $cron->min

=head2 @hours = $cron->hour

=head2 @mdays = $cron->mday

=head2 @months = $cron->mon

=head2 @wdays = $cron->wday

Accessors that return a list of the accepted values for each scheduling field.
These are returned in a plain list of numbers, regardless of the form they
were specified to the constructor.

Also note that the list of valid months will be 0-based (in the range 0 to 11)
rather than 1-based, to match the values used by C<localtime>, C<gmtime>,
C<mktime> and C<timegm>.
